# MkDocs on Github Pages

I'm serving this site via a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

There are two ways to do this:

1. As a **"user or organization site"**, which means it is published from
the `master` branch of of a repo named like `<username>.github.io`, and is
published at `http://username.github.io/`.

2. As a **"project site"**, which is served from a specific branch (like `gh-pages`)
of an existing project's repo, and is---published at
`http://username.github.io/repository`.

This site uses the first approach,
to get the fancy-schmancy http://ajfriend.github.io/ URL.


means we have to run `mkdocs build` manually before pushing.
can't do the fancy things that people do to automatically push.
