## gotta use this link syntax

I won't describe how to set up a Haskell programming environment, show you how
to write and run complete Haskell programs, or dive deeply into every language
construct we'll see. If you are interested in going further and actually
learning Haskell (and I hope you are!), then I recommend following Chris Allen's
great [learning path][learnhaskell].

Functions can take and return other functions. These are known as
[higher-order][] functions. In type signatures, any function arguments or return
values must be surrounded by parentheses:
