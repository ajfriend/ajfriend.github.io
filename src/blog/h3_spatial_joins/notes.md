# big ideas

- H3 ~= Hilbert curve?
    + eh, people will want to see that
- transform spatial problem with weird data formats into a standard CS problem, ordered searching and sorting
- summarize collections of hexes by their **bounding** hexes
    + that lets you skip lots of computation
- you have to work in the H3 space
    + translate everything there, and operations become fast
    + accept the geo accuracy tradeoffs
- compression as the default for storage/computation!
