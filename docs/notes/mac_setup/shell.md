# oh-my-zsh

Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and then
the [Powerlevel10k theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).

With this setup, you'll add customizations to as `.zsh` files
under the directory `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom`.

For example, you might add an `aliases.zsh` like

!!! example "`~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/aliases.zsh`"

    ```sh
    alias la="ls -altrh"
    export EDITOR='emacs'
    ```
