# Markdown notes

## Nice link syntax

[learnhaskell]: https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell
[higher-order]: http://learnyouahaskell.com/higher-order-functions
[you can use any bit of text]: https://ajfriend.github.io/

I forget where I first saw this, but they were recommending 
Chris Allen's [learning path][learnhaskell].
Elsewhere, they spoke about [higher-order][] functions.

I guess [you can use any bit of text][] for the second kind of link.

The above text is generated with this Markdown:

The definitions can go before or after their uses.
